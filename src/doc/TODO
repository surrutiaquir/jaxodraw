Developers TODO list:
=====================

The list is divided into the following sections:

  o  Bugs: Known bugs that should be solved
  o  Wish list: Requested features and changes
  o  Optimization: Suggested code optimizations
  o  Documentation: Is probably always out of date


Bugs
----
see BUGS


Wish list
---------

* Other export formats: tiff, bmp, gif
* Show gluons with two colors ?
* get axodraw2 released and incorporate it
* Preferences/Startup:
  - Allow preferences to be saved automatically on exit
  - Allowed startup without reading preferences
  - Allowed startup with opening all the files that were open when last quit
* Handle painting could be customizable

Optimization
------------

* Code Optimization:

    - pull out the MouseListener and MouseMotionListener methods
      from the canvas into a separate class, extending MouseInputAdapter
    - make JaxoCanvas a Component or a Canvas
    - Unify open/import/save/export error handling (Christian)
    - Cleanup JaxoPrefsPanel, e.g. a lot of duplicate code with JaxoGridBar
      (Christian)

* Interface Optimization:

    - Improve JSpinners in edit panels (Christian: rfe 1645880, bug 1657841,
      locale vs. number formatting problems, rounding problems)
    - Put canvas background into the preferences panel (Christian)
    - Make default fill color, isFilled, snappingToGrid
      configurable (Christian: rfe 1749368)
    - Something is still fishy with the recent files list (Christian)
    - Clarify which (grid) properties are tab-local (and not affected by
      changing the preferences).


Documentation
-------------

* Javadoc: The javadoc comments in the code should be reviewed

* FAQ: The FAQ can always be updated

* User guide: Should be updated
