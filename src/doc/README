2. What is it?
--------------
  JaxoDraw is Feynman graph plotting tool written in Java. It has a complete
  graphical user interface that allows all actions to be carried
  out via mouse click-and-drag operations. Graphs may be
  exported to a variety of formats and can be saved in XML files to be
  used for later sessions. One of JaxoDraw's main features is the
  possibility to create LaTeX files which make use of J. Vermaserens
  axodraw package to create a Feynman diagram via LaTeX and dvips. It was
  in fact the main motivation for writing JaxoDraw, to create a graphical
  user interface for the axodraw package.

2.3 Changes

3. Installation
---------------

3.1 Requirements
----------------
  JaxoDraw requires a Java 5 or later compatible virtual machine for
  your operating system. The most recent version of Java can be obtained from

      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html

  Please refer to the Oracle web pages for information on how to
  install Java on your system. We only support the official java from Oracle.
  Please only report problems if you encounter them with an official java version.

  NOTE in particular that JaxoDraw does not run or compile with GNU's java
  compiler gcj which is installed by default on many Linux distributions.

  The program runs on any platform that has a Java virtual machine installed,
  however, in the present version, there are a number of known bugs and
  limitations specific to certain operating systems.
  See the files TODO and BUGS for more information.

3.2 Compiling from Source
-------------------------
  The source distribution has the following directory structure:

    src/
        assembly/       Configuration files for the Maven assemby plugin
        changes/        Configuration files for the Maven changes plugin
        doc/            Documentation files
            colors/     Some notes on the use of colors in JaxoDraw
            legal/      License files
        main/
            java/       Java source files for JaxoDraw
            resources/  Various resources, icons, User Guide, etc.
        site/           The JaxoDraw web site (XML sources)
        test/
            java/       JUnit test files for JaxoDraw
            resources/  Test resources


  The following directories are not present in the original source distribution,
  they are generated by maven or have to be created manually:

    target/                 Compiled class files and resources
    target/site/apidocs/    API specification

  To build JaxoDraw you have to use Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/).
  Maven 3 can be used as well except for building the site,
  unless the maven 3 version of the site plugin is used.

  To compile JaxoDraw use
    mvn compile

  Then you run JaxoDraw with:
    java -cp target/classes/ net.sf.jaxodraw.JaxoDraw

  To create the jar executable:
    mvn package

  which can be executed with
    java -jar target/jaxodraw-xxx.jar


  To create the javadocs:
    javadoc -d target/site/apidocs/ [-link http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/] -link . -sourcepath src/main/java/ -subpackages net.sf.jaxodraw

  where the link parameter in square brackets is optional and is used
  in this case to link against the online java documentation from Oracle.

  In any case, the command has to be run twice in order to get the
  cross-references right.

  Alternatively, you may use maven:
    mvn javadoc:javadoc

3.3 Binaries
--------------

  The binary JaxoDraw.jar file may be executed with
    java -jar jaxodraw-xxx.jar

  or, depending on your operating system and setup,
  by simply double clicking on the .jar file icon.

  is in an HTML-based reference guide that is available via the Help menu
  of the graphical user interface of JaxoDraw or from our Web page:
      http://jaxodraw.sourceforge.net/

  The src/main/resources/usrGuide/ subdirectory of the source distribution
  contains the XML source code of the JaxoDraw user guide (in the xdocs/
  directory), the HTML version may be created by compiling and executing the
  file UserGuide2HTML.java).

  The API specification for JaxoDraw may be created from
  the sources as described in sec. 3.2.
