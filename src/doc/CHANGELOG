                **********


Changes from version 1.3-2 to version 2.0-0 (20.11.2008)
_____________________________________________________

o New features

    * Added a plugin infrastructure. Users can write plugins for custom
      import/export formats that can be installed independently and will
      be recognized by new versions of JaxoDraw.

    * Log records are now written to a rotating sequence of files
      in a default log directory.

    * Added Bezier curves as drawing style. Beziers can be drawn for all
      particle modes, including gluons and photons.

    * New edit mode 'Select' that allows to perform the actions of the
      faint-box popup menu on an arbitrary set of objects.
      Replace the Group button by a Replace button.

    * Editing objects from the edit panel now has an immediate effect on the
      object so that editing operations can be previewed on the fly.

    * The command line option "-nosplash" can now be used in order not to
      show the splash window on startup.

    * The command line option "--convert" can now be used to convert a number
      of <strong>JaxoDraw</strong> xml files to axodraw4j tex files
      (and vice versa) without the need of bringing up the user interface.

    * Objects with fill color can now be optionally unfilled (only drawing
      their boundary). Jaxodraw now understands the axodraw commands
      \Etri, \EBox and \Oval.

    * Make the symmetry of a photon arc configurable.

    * Photon and gluon arcs are now painted during resizing.

    * Multiple files can be specified on the command line and will be
      opened in multiple tabs.

    * Groups are now rescaled by dragging, like all other objects.

    * Added multiple undo/redo functionalities.

    * Added scroll bars to the canvas panel.

    * Right click and drag on the Canvas will show the faint box which
      can be used to enclose objects. On release, you will be presented a menu
      for which you can choose several operations to be applied to the current
      selection.

    * A double click with the right mouse button brings up
      the edit panel for the nearest object.

o Bug fixes

    * Fixed the bug that made JaxoDraw hang if
      axodraw.sty was not installed or not found.

    * The arrow of dashed objects (ghosts and scalars) was also drawn dashed,
      and the bounding box of objects was not correct when the line width was
      too large.

    * Popup menus now update their look-and-feel.

    * Prevent various dialogs from going into the background and blocking
      the main window.

    * Various fixes to language bundles.

    * Fixed the bug for which the PS text edit panel font size selector
      was too small and overwritten by the font name selector.

    * Fixed the bug for which drawing an arc by dragging its last point would
      show only its visual aid and not the arc object itself.

    * Fixed the bug which caused some erractical behavior of groups
      when moved in snapping mode.

    * Various LaTeX import fixes.

    * Fixed the bug which caused the 'out of memory' exception
      when opening a number of tabs above a certain threshold.

    * File operations (Open, Save, Import, ...) now work
      on Windows if the path to the file contains white spaces.

    * Fixed the bug that resizing a triangular vertex from the point that
      was last clicked when it was drawn didn't work.

    * Fixed the bug that when setting the alignment property of a
      latex text to cc (center-center) and the rotation angle to a
      non-zero value, the resulting latex file could not be compiled.

o Structural changes

    * JaxoDraw now uses its own version of the axodraw style file,
      called axodraw4j.sty. This style file has to be installed separately.

    * The preferences are not stored in a file .Jaxorc anymore,
      the standard Java Preferences API is used instead.
      A folder .jaxodraw in the user home directory is used
      to store installation data, plugins and user guide.

    * The drawing of photons and gluons has been adjusted to use the same
      algorithms as the postscript code in the axodraw style file.
      Different output formats are entirely consistent now, however
      some strange effects happen for special configurations,
      e.g. gluon loops with very small radii.

    * The jre binary distributions have been removed, users should properly
      install a Java Runtime Environment on their systems.

    * SVG support has been removed from the core program, it is now
      available as a separate plugin.

    * The directory layout and package structure has changed.

    * The "Copy" mode has been renamed to "Duplicate" to avoid confusion
      with the usual clipboard "Copy" action.

    * Several key strokes have been set to more "standard" combinations.
      These include: Copy (Ctrl + C), Paste (Ctrl + V), Cut (Ctrl + X),
      Save (Ctrl + S), Save As (Ctrl + Shift + S), Import (Ctrl + R),
      Export (Ctrl + Shift + R).

o Incompatibilities

    * Due to extensive refactoring, JaxoDraw-2.0 is not compatible
      with any earlier version of the program. Note in particular that
      xml files that were generated with earlier versions will generally
      not be imported.

                **********


Changes from version 1.3-1 to version 1.3-2 (24.3.2006)
_____________________________________________________

o New features

    * Make the Mac OS X README file available from the Help menu (Mac only).

o Bug fixes

    * Arc drawing bugs:
      - The faint box is not drawn when you are in Arc mode.
      - If you are in Arc mode, arcs and right/center click +
        dragging 2 times + left click you will get an arc on the Canvas.

    * Fixed the bug that text edit panels didn't have focus.

    * Fixed the bug that the fill color was not preserved after
      editing a fill object.

    * Fixed a bug with the rendering of double lines.

    * Fixed the bug that editing a postscript text did not
      work in a saved and re-opened graph.


                **********


Changes from version 1.3-0 to version 1.3-1 (29.6.2005)
_____________________________________________________

o Bug fixes

    * Fixed the bug that editing the coordinates of a line object was broken
      in the 1.3-0 release.

    * Fixed a bug with the local install on Linux using the ant script.


                **********


Changes from version 1.2-0 to version 1.3-0 (20.6.2005)
_____________________________________________________

o New features

    * Rewrote the export dialog for key-friendlyness: tab key toggles between
      items, space selects, escape cancels. In the export formats combobox you
      can choose an entry by pressing its first character or go up and down
      with the arrow keys.

    * new export formats JPG and PNG

    * SVG export and preview using batik (optional)

    * New vertex type diamond

    * LaTeX text rotation implemented through pstricks

    * Added default return mode

    * Added a dynamic zoom

    * Rotation of Postscript texts

    * Added a contrib/ directory to the source distribution
      that contains relevant/useful stuff contributed by other people.
      For now there is just a command line interface for transforming
      JaxoDraw xml files to latex (thanks to Thomas Reiter).

o Bug fixes

    * Fixed the bug that arcs were messed up when re-opening saved files.

    * Fixed the bug that dragging arcs caused strange behavior.

    * Fixed the bug that small arcs were not drawn.

    * Fixed the bug that photon and gluon arcs are not correctly
      exported to LaTeX.

    * Fixed the bug that JaxoDraw crashed if certain fonts were installed.

    * Fixed the bug that the preferences panel did not come up
      when using Java 5.0.

    * Fixed the bug that putting the text string in a PS edit panel
      to an empty string resulted in an exception.

o Code clean ups

    * Reviewed the whole code to comply with standard Java naming conventions.
      Now, a compilation with version 1.22 of IBM's jikes compiler does not
      give any warning messages even with the +P (pedantic) switch.

    * New JaxoSplashWindow; restructured JaxoAxodraw;
      objectList and packageList in SaveGraph are now ArrayLists, not Vectors;
      new JaxoVertex class that is superclass for all vertices (except T5);
      restructured the export classes: renamed JaxoExport to JaxoExportPanel
      and JaxoExport is an abstract superclass for the other export classes;
      restructured all loop objects;

o Structural changes

    * New directory structure, all source files and resources are now in src/,
      all the resources have to be copied over at compile time.

    * Ant script changes: you will need the latest ant-1.6.2 from JPackage,
      and also the ant-nodeps, ant-jsch, ant-trax, xerces-j2, xml-commons,
      xml-commons-apis and xml-commons-resolver rpms.
      The generated jar file now contains the version number.
      You do not have to be root anymore to run the 'install'
      target (an ordinary user can install to his home directory).

    * Rewrote jaxodraw.spec: the rpms now conform to the standarts of the
      JPackage project (http://www.jpackage.org/), the jpackage-utils rpm
      is a build- and runtime requirement. Replaced the jaxodraw-source rpm
      by the .src.rpm and renamed jaxodraw-manual to jaxodraw-userGuide.


                **********


Changes from version 1.1-0 to version 1.2-0 (21.7.2004)
_____________________________________________________

o New features

    * Arcs are now three-point objects: to draw them you will have to
      click thrice on the canvas. Also triangular vertices are now drawn
      like that.

    * Introduced a hexagonal grid. Each canvas tab can now have
      both its own grid type as well as its own grid size.

    * Introduced the WatchFile mode.

    * Introduced radio buttons in the vertex menus to indicate the currently
      active Vertex mode.

    * Introduced more preferences that can be set by the user.

    * The Preferences panel has been restructured for a clearer layout.

    * The use of colors is now fully consistent with axodraw (when the filling
      color of a box/blob is a grayscale, the line color has to be black).

    * PSText now can display curly brackets like in LaTeX: \{ and \}

    * Many more fonts are now available in PSText mode because we do not filter
      out fonts anymore that cannot display greek characters (however, see the
      corresponding entry in the BUGS file). This was done to work around a bug
      in Apple's Java implementation for MacOSX (see below), where the default
      font "Default" was incorrectly reported as not being able to display
      greek characters.

    * Several MacOSX specific enhancements, eg. menu key short cuts,
      key short cuts for middle and right mouse button, a preference for
      the latex and dvips path, which allows internal latex compilation, etc.

    * Added "Java Runtime Version" under "System Info" (important to distinguish
      different Java implementations on MacOSX).


o Bug fixes

    * Fixed the bug that the color of a group could not be changed directly
      through the color button.

    * Fixed the bug that after editing a group with LaTeX labels,
      the size of the latter was always set to "tiny".

    * Fixed the bug that when the grid was switched on and the canvas
      contained objects at an arbitrary position, if the latter were moved
      they would get shifted by the grid size and not anchored to grid points.

    * Fixed the bug that closing curly brackets did not display in PSText mode.

    * MacOSX only: fixed the bug that editing a PSText object gave an
      exception. This is really due to a bug in Apple's Java implementation:
      the default font "Default" is incorrectly reported as not being able to
      display greek characters. The same bug also prevented the Preferences
      panel from popping up.


o Code clean ups

    * Reviewed the whole code to comply with standard Java naming conventions.
      Now, a compilation with version 1.21 of IBM's jikes compiler does not
      give any warning messages even with the +P (pedantic) switch.


o Structural changes

    * The preferences class has been fully restructered: split it into
      JaxoPrefs.java and JaxoPrefsPanel.java. The preferences have been moved
      from JaxoDraw.java into JaxoPrefs.java and they all have
      getter/setter methods now.

    * Privatized all non-static, non-final variables, in particular in
      the JaxoObject, JaxoPrefs and JaxoMainPanel classes.

    * Rewrote jaxodraw.spec: a j2sdk > 1.4.1 rpm is now required for
      installation (use --force if Java is installed but not with rpm), and
      there are several sub-packages built: jaxodraw-source, jaxodraw-javadoc,
      and jaxodraw-manual.

    * Included a MacOSX sub-directory that mimics the structure of a Mac
      Application bundle.


                **********


Changes from version 1.0-1 to version 1.1 (1.3.2004)
_____________________________________________________

o New features

    * Internationalized JaxoDraw. For now there are english, german, french,
      spanish and italian translations. Added an entry in the Options Menu that
      allows to change the language at run-time.

    * Implemented sub- and superscripts for Postscript Text.

    * Added the possibility to include custom Latex packages.

    * Added a pop-up menu to the vertex button (added also a triangle vertex).

    * Allow for import of existing Latex files.

    * Implemented 'tabbed' graphs, i.e., work with several graphs at a time.

    * Implemented 'grouping', i.e., the user may group objects together
      to edit/move/copy them in one go.

    * Added Language and Amplitude to the Preferences dialog.

    * Implemented the possibility of drawing all particle objects with a
      double line (the separation between the lines can be chosen).

    * The text of a Latex text object is indicated in a pop-up menu on top of
      the canvas when the "TeX" icon is rolled over.

    * Added JSpinners to the number fields in all the edit panels, so they may
      be edited with the mouse only.

    * Added a list of recently opened files to the File menu.

    * Added an extra handle to line objects (in the middle of them), for an
      easier selection of end-attached lines.

    * The current file flag in the status bar is now a current direcory flag
      (the current file is given by the name of the tab). If the path is too
      long then it is cut off to fit in the flag panel.


o Bug fixes

    * Fixed the bug that choosing the color of a LaTeX label did not
      affect the final LaTeX output.

    * Fixed the bug that caused a copied arrowed line to always
      flip the arrow direction

    * Fixed the bug that when a LaTeX text file was previewed with the
      Java - internal previewer (i.e. without having set a custom previewer
      in the preferences), the page could not be scrolled.


o Code clean ups

    * Reviewed the whole code to comply with standard Java naming conventions.
      Now, a compilation with version 1.19 of IBM's jikes compiler does not
      give any warning messages even with the +P (pedantic) switch.

    * The source code has been formatted with version 1.15-3 of Artistic Style
      (http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) with the --style=java option.


o Structural changes

    * Split the Text class into LatexText and PSText.

    * Introduced the Ant script build.xml to allow for a
      platform-independent build process (see: http://ant.apache.org/).
      Type "ant -projecthelp" for a list of possible options.
      The build.properties file contains user-definable settings.

    * Removed the following bash scripts in favor of the ant script:
      clean.bsh, compile.bsh, doc.bsh, install.bsh and uninstall.bsh.
      Removed jaxodraw.bsh and only kept the runme.bsh script
      which is necessary for installation on Linux. Moved the files
      jaxodraw.spec and runme.bsh into a subdirectory Linux/.

    * Rewrote jaxodraw.spec: it is not necessary anymore to be root for
      building an rpm. The rpm will be found in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/
      and is called jaxodraw-1.1-0.noarch.rpm. It requires an
      rpm for axodraw which is available from our website.


o Incompatibilities

    * Due to the restructuring of the Text class, xml files generated
      with JaxoDraw-1.0-1 or earlier that contain LaTeX labels cannot
      be read by JaxoDraw-1.1-0. A workaround is to export them as tex
      files from JaxoDraw-1.0-1 and then import them in JaxoDraw-1.1-0.


                **********


Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.0-1 (16.9.2003)
_____________________________________________________


* Fixed the Bug that the Antialias and LooknFeel preferences were not
  saved on a permanent basis.

* Fixed the Bug that the LooknFeel and GridSize were not applied to the
  current session when the OK button was pressed in the Preferences menu.

* Fixed the Bug that did not allow to get the dot back as a vertex, once
  a different vertex type was chosen.

* Fixed the Bug that a file created via LaTeX - EPS was always put into
  the directory JaxoDraw was started from and not the directory chosen
  by the user.

* Fixed the Bug that JaxoDraw created LaTeX files using the user's
  current locale instead of a fixed one. This resulted in some locales
  (the german one, in particular) that a comma (,) appeared instead of a
  point (.) as a decimal separator in all floating numbers created by
  JaxoDraw. Strangely, the LaTeX compilation does not complain about
  this, but the resulting postscript file is corrupted.

* Fixed the bug that when the user creates by mistake a zero size object
  the resulting postscript file was corrupted.
